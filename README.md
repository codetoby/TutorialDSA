# Data Structures and Algorithms Tutorial Exercises

This repository contains solutions to the weekly tutorial exercises for the Data Structures and Algorithms course. Each week, students were provided with a set of questions to solve, covering various topics such as linked lists, trees, sorting algorithms, searching algorithms, and more. The solutions provided here are my own implementations of these exercises.
